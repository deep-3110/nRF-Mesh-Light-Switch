Android Application for provisioning Nordic Semiconductor Devices ie nRF 52840 Development kit and Dongle and Thingy 52.
It can be used for provision devices in a Mesh network and turn on/off the light on the server devices
You can even configure one device as a client ie a switch and turn on lights of server devices using it
